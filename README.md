# devops_kata

This is a sample project to support a small kata about devops.

## Requirements

To minimize the environment requirements we will use vagrant as a provisioner for our environment. 

So basically we need to install:

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
